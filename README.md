## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Tweaks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **YOU MUST RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR**
> 
> This script requires elevated privileges to modify system services and the registry. Always use the included **`RUN_ChoomCore.cmd`** file.

1.¬† **Download:** Download the two main files: `ChoomCore_Tweaks.ps1` and **`RUN_ChoomCore.cmd`**.
2.¬† **Execute:** Double-click **`RUN_ChoomCore.cmd`** to start the process.
3.¬† **Confirm:** Accept the User Account Control (UAC) prompt to allow the script to run as Administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> The `RUN_ChoomCore.cmd` uses the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` flag. This allows the script to run locally without changing your system's global security policies.
